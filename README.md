## What is customer churn and why it is important for companies

Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company's product ro servidce during a certain time frame. We can calculate chrun rate by dividing the number of customers we lost during that time period by the number of customers we had at the beginning of that time period. For example, if the company starts the quarter with 400 customers and end with 380, the churn rate is 5% because the company lost 5% of the total customers. Obviously, the company should aim for a churn rate that is as close to 0% as possible. In order to achieve that, the company must know at all times what the churn rate is, and treat it as it's top priority. Now, a question might arise as to why it is necessary to calculate churn rate. Typically any company will lose a few customers sporadically, and the 5% that we calculated doesn't seem too bad right? Well, we first need to take into consideration that acquiring new customers is far more expensive than retaining the already loyal ones.This happens because returning customers are 67% more likely to spend more on our products and services. As a result our company will spend less on the operating costs of having to acquire new customers. We don't need to spend time and money on convincing that our product is actually worth it because the returning customer has already made that decision for us.

## How to reduce Customer Churn
Focus your attention on the best customers
Rather than simply focusing on offering incentives to customers who are considering churning, it could be even more beneficial to pool your resources into the loyal, and profitable customers instead.
